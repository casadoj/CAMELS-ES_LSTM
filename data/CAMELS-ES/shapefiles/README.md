This directory containts two shapefiles:

* catchments_camelses.shp contains the polygon layer of the catchments included in CAMELS-ES

* stations_camelses.shp contains a point layer of the gauging stations whose catchments are included in CAMELS-ESP. 
  The only non self-explanatory attributes in this layer are 'lat_efas' and 'lon_efas', which are the coordinates of the station adjusted to fit the river network in EFASv5,
  and 'active' who defines whether the station was still working in 2020 or not.
